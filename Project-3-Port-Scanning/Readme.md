Project 3: Port Scanning
Objective
I performed a port scan to understand a key step in cybersecurity reconnaissance. My goal was to identify open ports on a system and analyze the network traffic generated by the scan.

Methodology
I used Nmap and Wireshark: I chose these two industry-standard tools for my analysis. Nmap is a powerful port scanner, and Wireshark allows for deep packet inspection.

I ran the scan: I executed the command nmap -sT 127.0.0.1 to scan my local machine. This specific command performed a TCP Connect Scan, attempting to establish a full connection with each port.

I analyzed the traffic: I used Wireshark to capture the network packets during the scan. I applied the filter tcp.flags.syn == 1 and tcp.flags.ack == 0 to isolate the specific SYN packets sent by Nmap. This allowed me to see the flood of connection attempts directly.

Conclusion
This project confirmed that I can use network scanning tools to discover potential entry points into a system. My analysis of the captured packets also demonstrated an understanding of how a port scan works at a fundamental level, highlighting the importance of securing and monitoring network services.
