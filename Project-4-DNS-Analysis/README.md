Project 4: DNS Traffic Analysis
Objective
I analyzed Domain Name System (DNS) traffic to understand how it operates and to discover hidden connections that occur in the background during web browsing.

Methodology
I used Wireshark: I used the Wireshark tool to capture network traffic while visiting a website.

I applied a filter: I applied the dns filter to isolate the DNS query and response packets.

I analyzed the results: I discovered that the web browser made DNS requests to multiple sources (such as for ads or analytics) in addition to the main website I visited.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to analyze DNS traffic to understand network behavior and how domain names are translated into IP addresses. This is a fundamental skill for identifying malicious activity and understanding network communication.
